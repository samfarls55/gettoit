# AFK Execution Run — 2026-05-20-1743

Goal: execute all open AFK issues not blocked by a HITL issue.

## Work set
- Ready (wave 1): sg-WF-4
- Waiting (blocked by open AFK):
  - tb-WF-5 <- sg-WF-4
  - tb-WF-4 <- sg-WF-4, tb-WF-5
  - tb-WF-7 <- tb-WF-5
  - tb-WF-6 <- tb-WF-5, tb-WF-4
  - tb-WF-8 <- tb-WF-5, tb-WF-7
  - tb-WF-9 <- tb-WF-5, tb-WF-8
- Excluded (HITL-blocked): —
- Skipped (needs-info / unparseable): —

`ready-issues.mjs` flag on sg-WF-4: `no-blocked-by-section` — the issue uses the heading `## Blocks / blocked by` (combined section) rather than the canonical `## Blocked by`. Inspected the file: "Blocked by: none. All grill prereqs resolved." Safe to queue.

## Event log
- 17:43 — preflight green: tree clean, on `main`, even with `origin/main`
- 17:43 — `ready-issues.mjs`: 1 ready (sg-WF-4), 6 waiting, 0 excluded
- 17:43 — wave 1: spawning sg-WF-4 alone (sole keystone; everything else waits on it)
- 18:00 — sg-WF-4 merged via PR #179; GitHub #157 closed via `Closes`; local `main` ff'd to `88b7a0a`
- 18:01 — `ready-issues.mjs` re-run: 0 ready, 6 waiting — false cycle (tb-WF-4 <-> tb-WF-5) flagged
- 18:02 — manually inspected `## Blocked by` sections per skill rule: tb-WF-4's bullet blockers (sg-WF-1, tb-WF-1, sg-WF-4) are all done; tb-WF-5 reference is in trailing prose ("both can ship in parallel") — script over-counted. tb-WF-4 genuinely ready; tb-WF-5 genuinely waits on tb-WF-4 (needs `SetupScreen(mode: .solo)` constructor).
- 18:02 — wave 2: spawning tb-WF-4 alone
- 18:35 — tb-WF-4 merged via PR #180; GitHub #163 closed via `Closes`; local `main` ff'd to `87e803a`
- 18:36 — `ready-issues.mjs` re-run: 1 ready (tb-WF-5), 4 waiting, 0 excluded
- 18:36 — user bumped concurrency cap from 2 → 3 for remainder; doesn't help this wave (only 1 ready) but unblocks wave 4 (tb-WF-6 + tb-WF-7 fan out from tb-WF-5)
- 18:36 — wave 3: spawning tb-WF-5 alone
- 18:59 — tb-WF-5 merged via PR #181; GitHub #174 closed; local `main` ff'd to `57e95b5`
- 19:02 — `ready-issues.mjs` re-run: 2 ready (tb-WF-6, tb-WF-7), 2 waiting (tb-WF-8 on tb-WF-7, tb-WF-9 on tb-WF-8)
- 19:02 — wave 4: spawning tb-WF-6 + tb-WF-7 in parallel (both touch `PlanListScreen.swift` — second-to-merge rebases per brief)
- 19:03 — user reported: CI run #303 (post-merge main on `57e95b5`) failed. iOS lane reds with 9 `*IntegrationTests` failures.
- 19:04 — diagnosed: failures all share `x-sb-error-code: over_request_rate_limit` from Supabase Auth. NOT a code regression — `57e95b5`'s pre-merge PR build (#181) was green, the rapid-fire cycle of 3 PR + 3 main CI runs in ~75 min exhausted Supabase Auth's hourly budget.
- 19:04 — halted run per skill rule. Stopped tb-WF-6 + tb-WF-7 agents; their downstream CI runs would have compounded the rate limit.
- Failing tests (all environmental):
  - RoomStoreIntegrationTests (3): joinRoom, RLS hide, updateSessionParameters
  - SessionSnapshotIntegrationTests (1): fetchSnapshot
  - VerdictIntegrationTests (3): fetchVerdict nil, RLS insert, RLS read
  - VotesIntegrationTests (2): fullQuizHappyPath, RLS blocks non-member insert
- 19:11 — user bumped Supabase Auth rate limits in dashboard (`gettoit-prod` → Auth → Rate Limits)
- 19:11 — re-ran #303 failed jobs (`gh run rerun 26183584025 --failed`); confirmed no stale `afk/tb-wf-*` branches on origin
- 19:12 — resumed wave 4: re-spawning tb-WF-6 + tb-WF-7 in parallel
- 19:35 — `gh run rerun 26183584025 --failed` (re-run of #303) completed GREEN on all 9 jobs including iOS — confirms rate-limit bump was the right lever, no code change needed
- 19:39 — tb-WF-6 merged via PR #182 + docs closeout PR #183; GitHub #175 closed; local `main` ff'd to `d8b4606`
- waiting on tb-WF-7 (still running)
- 20:27 — tb-WF-7 merged via PR #184; GitHub #176 closed; local `main` ff'd to `12188b5`. Follow-up PR #185 landed at 20:34 (vault closeout + live-join progressWriter fix); main now at `9c791e9`
- 20:35 — post-merge main CI on `9c791e9` in_progress (not yet observed); prior post-merge on `12188b5` was green — auth rate-limit holding
- 20:35 — **paused per user instruction**; will not spawn tb-WF-8 until explicitly resumed

## Status at pause

- **Merged (5):** sg-WF-4, tb-WF-4, tb-WF-5, tb-WF-6, tb-WF-7
- **Remaining open:**
  - tb-WF-8 (#177) — Decided + History sections + lifecycle transitions. Now unblocked (sole blocker tb-WF-7 done).
  - tb-WF-9 (#178) — Three-dot menu + destructive actions. Still blocked on tb-WF-8.
- **Heads-up for resume:** tb-WF-7 added a new migration `supabase/migrations/20260521000000000_members_quiz_progress.sql`; tb-WF-8 will branch from a `main` that has it. Monitor the post-merge main CI on `9c791e9` before next spawn.

## Resume

- 21:18 — user resumed via `/execute-issues`
- 21:18 — preflight green: tree clean, on `main`, even with `origin/main`; last two main CI runs both success on `12188b5` + `9c791e9` (auth rate-limit holding since dashboard bump)
- 21:18 — `ready-issues.mjs` re-run: 1 ready (tb-WF-8), 1 waiting (tb-WF-9 on tb-WF-8)
- 21:18 — wave 5: spawning tb-WF-8 alone
- 21:50 — tb-WF-8 merged via PR #186 + docs closeout PR #187; GitHub #177 closed; local `main` ff'd to `fcab083`
- 21:53 — `ready-issues.mjs` re-run: 1 ready (tb-WF-9), 0 waiting — final wave
- 21:53 — wave 6: spawning tb-WF-9 alone (last AFK issue in the workflow-overhaul phase)
- 22:21 — tb-WF-9 merged via PR #188 + docs closeout PR #189; GitHub #178 closed; local `main` ff'd to `c4df9dc`
- 22:22 — `ready-issues.mjs` final run: 0 ready, 0 waiting — workflow-overhaul AFK backlog fully drained
- 22:22 — run closed

  - sg-WF-4 — Plan list surface spec ([PR #179](https://github.com/samfarls55/gettoit/pull/179))

  - tb-WF-8 — Decided + History lifecycle ([PR #186](https://github.com/samfarls55/gettoit/pull/186))

- **Skipped:** —
- **Escalated / failed:** —
- **Stranded:** —

### Incidents

- **Supabase Auth rate limit (19:03–19:35).** Post-merge main CI #303 on `57e95b5` (tb-WF-5) failed 9 integration tests with `over_request_rate_limit`. NOT a code regression — burst of 6 auth-heavy CI runs in 75 min exhausted the default signups+signins/5min limit. Halted wave 4 mid-flight (killed tb-WF-6 + tb-WF-7 first attempts), user bumped the dashboard knob (`Auth → Rate Limits → Rate limit for sign-ups and sign-ins`), `gh run rerun 26183584025 --failed` recovered #303 GREEN, wave 4 was respawned and merged cleanly. Memory captured at `memory/project_supabase_auth_rate_limit_ci.md` so the next chained AFK run pre-checks the knob.

### Schema deltas landed

- `20260521000000000_members_quiz_progress.sql` (tb-WF-7) — `members.quiz_progress jsonb` for resume-from-state on Joined cards
- `20260522000000000_plans_decided_history_lifecycle.sql` (tb-WF-8) — `plans.verdict_fired_at` + `plans.expired_at` + 2 RPCs (`plans_decided_for_user`, `plans_history_for_user`) + `check_ins` trigger to transition `decided-active → expired`

### Design-system additions landed

- New surface: `surfaces/00-plan-list.md` + `code/screens/ScreenPlanList.jsx` (replaces superseded `00-landing.md`)
- New components: C-25 Action Dot Menu, C-26 Floating Action Button
- README + CHANGELOG updated; iOS retired the now-superseded S01 + S01b JSX

### Manual sweep flagged for follow-up (not in this run's scope)

- tb-WF-5 retired `LandingScreen.swift` and left `RootView` Settings entry orphaned — needs a new entry point (separate issue)
- Reroll-from-Plan-list wire is a no-op in tb-WF-8's Decided onReroll closure — live reroll-from-list is follow-on alongside whatever lands next on rerolls
- Reroll window deadline computation remains sg-WF-6's territory (`23:59:59 next-calendar-day local-TZ` semantic still placeholder)
