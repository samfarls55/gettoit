# v1.1 — Dogfood follow-ups

Post-build feedback against the v1 TestFlight build, captured during the first real-device install on 2026-05-14. Source raw note: [[testflight-first-dogfood-2026-05-14|testflight-first-dogfood-2026-05-14]] (lives next to this index after compile).

## Framing

These items are follow-ups to v1, not part of the original v1 PRD ([[../../10_prds/v1-prd|v1-prd.md]]). v1 is feature-complete (TB-00 → TB-17 ✅); v1.1 captures defects and gaps surfaced once the build was on a real device.

**State as of 2026-05-14:** the original 11 candidates were grilled, split, and published. Three artifact kinds in v1.1 (`bug` is new; `spec-gap` and `tracer-bullet` carry over from v1). Three candidates do not appear as v1.1 issues — #2b and #10 deferred to the pre-public-launch milestone, #11 withdrawn (folded into [[issues/sg-02-landing-page-surface|sg-02]]). See [[#Resolutions (post-grilling, 2026-05-14)]] for the per-candidate decisions.

### Dependency notes

Spec-gaps + bugs are dependency-free at the v1.1 layer — any can start immediately. Tracer-bullets pair 1-to-1 with the surface-introducing spec-gaps:

- `tb-01` consumes `sg-02` landing surface.
- `tb-02` consumes `sg-03` sign-in + waiting-screen specs.
- `tb-03` consumes `sg-04` permission + selector specs. The LocationPicker component decision was resolved 2026-05-14 (see [[../../60_engineering/adr/0009-locationpicker-as-reusable-component|ADR 0009]] — reusable `C-23 LocationPicker`); sg-04 is now AFK.

`bug-03` (Q5 placeholders) shares root-cause space with `tb-03` (location selector) — wiring location may resolve bug-03 as a side effect, but bug-03 owns its own acceptance criteria.

## Artifact kinds

v1.1 introduces one new artifact kind beyond v1's existing taxonomy:

- `bug` *(new)* — defect against shipped v1 functionality. No spec change required; localized code fix.
- `tracer-bullet` *(existing)* — vertical build slice for new functionality.
- `spec-gap` *(existing)* — change to the locked `design-system/` spec.
- `research` *(new)* — research spike that ships a vault doc, not code.

## Quiz redesign & verdict engine (PRD 2026-05-15)

Build slices decomposed from [[../../10_prds/v1.1-quiz-redesign-prd|v1.1 Quiz Redesign & Verdict Engine PRD]] via `/to-issues` on 2026-05-15. Vertical capability slices — all AFK. Canonical design record: [[../../50_product/v1.1-quiz-amendments|v1.1-quiz-amendments]].

Build order: research-01 first (blocks all Foursquare work), then tb-04 → tb-13 along the dependency graph above.

## Q5 wiring + PlacesProxy fix (2026-05-16)

Decomposed via `/to-issues` after a Q5 diagnosis session. Symptom: Q5 rendered location-generic options and the Foursquare API was never hit. Two faults:

1. **PlacesProxy is dark.** The `places-proxy` Edge Function is invoked by the live quiz but never reaches Foursquare — every call falls through to the on-device MapKit fallback. A deployment / secrets gap, not a credentials problem (the Foursquare key is known-good from one v1-dev call).
2. **The v1.1 Q5 pipeline was built but never wired in.** tb-07 (`FoursquareFetchPlanner` / `FoursquareFetchExecutor`), tb-08 (`Q5FactorialCardGenerator`), tb-09 (axis scorers) and tb-10 (`RunningUnionPoolManager`) all shipped as unit-tested components, but each issue flagged "not wired into the live quiz" as an adjacency and named the *next* issue as the home for the wiring. The wiring never happened — the live quiz still runs the bug-03 tracer-bullet bridge (`Q5CandidatesLoader`): one fetch, early, with empty filters, truncated to three.

Build order: tb-14, tb-15, tb-17 can start immediately; tb-16 after tb-15. tb-15's end-to-end verification against live Foursquare data depends on tb-14, but its boundary tests do not.

**Adjacency flagged, not filed.** `RunningUnionPoolManager` (tb-10) shows the same not-wired-in smell on the *verdict* side — see [[verdict-pipeline-pool-manager-unwired|verdict-pipeline-pool-manager-unwired]]. Out of scope for the Q5 fix; needs its own diagnosis pass before it becomes an issue.

**Follow-up surfaced by tb-14 (2026-05-16) — RESOLVED 2026-05-17.** tb-14 closed the deploy gap, but the deployed function returned an *empty* `places` array. Diagnosed against the live API: two faults, not the hypothesised bad-key/version-pin — (1) the Foursquare account had no API credits, so every premium-field call 429'd; (2) the cuisine/dietary category ids were legacy short numerics the post-2025 surface rejects with 400. Both were swallowed by a silent-4xx handler path. Resolved: operator added Foursquare credits + PR #101 (correct hex ids, handler now surfaces the error). See [[placesproxy-empty-foursquare-results|placesproxy-empty-foursquare-results]] §Resolution.

**Adjacency flagged during the tb-14 run (2026-05-16).** The `ios` CI lane's integration tests (`RoomStore` / `Verdict` / `Votes` `IntegrationTests`) flake against the shared live Supabase DB — same commit passed and failed on re-run across the rapid tb-14 PR cadence. Pre-existing, not a tb-14 regression (tb-14 changed no Swift). Flagged in [[ios-integration-tests-flaky-on-shared-db|ios-integration-tests-flaky-on-shared-db]]; needs CI-hardening triage.

## Premium-data follow-ups (2026-05-17)

After the Foursquare account moved to a paid (credit-backed) plan, a session diagnosed the empty-`places` follow-up and audited whether the premium fields could retrieve the Q1-Q4 quiz inputs better than the free-tier-era workarounds.

**Shipped — category-id fix (PR [#101](https://github.com/samfarls55/gettoit/pull/101)).** The cuisine + dietary category ids were legacy short numerics the post-2025 Foursquare surface rejects with HTTP 400; replaced with live-probed hex ids, `FoursquareCategory.id` → `fsq_category_id`, and the handler now surfaces a `foursquare_upstream_<status>` error instead of a silent empty 200. Closes the [[placesproxy-empty-foursquare-results|placesproxy-empty-foursquare-results]] follow-up (with the operator's Foursquare credit top-up). Not filed as a tracked issue — fixed directly. ADR 0002 corrected.

**Audit result — only Q4 still on a workaround.** Q1 cuisine (category-id filter), Q2 spend cap (`max_price` + `price`), Q3 reputation (`rating`/`stats`/`date_created`, already migrated by tb-16) are all on the right mechanism. Q4 vibe is the only quiz axis still inferred from a free-tier-era workaround (category archetype + price tie-break).

**research-02 done 2026-05-18 (PR #113).** The live-data spike is filed at [[../../60_engineering/research/foursquare-tastes-vibe-2026-05/_index|foursquare-tastes-vibe-2026-05]]: a 1090-venue sample of the live Foursquare `tastes` field, a 2732-token frequency table, and a curated **30-token vibe-token allowlist** (16 `+1` / 14 `-1`). Measured `tastes` coverage is **66.8%**, correcting the ~76% estimate the tb-18 ticket and research-01 carried. tb-18 (#102) is now unblocked — it transcribes the allowlist verbatim.

**Triaged 2026-05-18.** A `/triage` + `/grill-with-docs` session resolved tb-18's three design questions (vibe = category-archetype baseline + bounded ±1 `tastes` nudge; price tie-break demoted to last-resort; graded-axis already closed by [[research-01-foursquare-filter-surface|research-01]] §6). The live-data allowlist build was split out as `research-02`. tb-18 is now the implementation tracer-bullet, blocked by it. The research-01 report §5 was corrected — the 2026-05-17 audit reversed its `attributes`/`tastes` ranking.

**research-03 done 2026-05-18.** Reviewing research-02's headline finding surfaced that the **66.8% `tastes` coverage is only the ceiling** on the Q4 nudge, not its fire-rate — a venue inside that 66.8% still gets no nudge if its tokens are all noise or net to zero. research-03 replayed the merged tb-18 `Q5VenueClassifier.tastesNudge` logic offline over the research-02 sample (no new API calls) and measured the real **fire-rate at 46.3%** (505 of 1090). Funnel: 1090 sampled → 728 tastes-bearing → 571 token-matched → 505 non-zero net. The nudge is restaurant/bar-shaped (fire-rate ~60%), near-dead for cafes (22.7%), and strongly loud-skewed (82% of fires push louder); only 66 venues net-zero cancel. Verdict: **keep the nudge as specified** — it moves nearly half of every pool at trivial complexity cost. A future lever, if quiet verdicts under-serve, is a wider cafe-and-quiet-aware allowlist, not removal. Written up in §7 of [[../../60_engineering/research/foursquare-tastes-vibe-2026-05/report\|foursquare-tastes-vibe-2026-05]].

**Adjacency flagged, not filed.** Foursquare's `attributes` field (`outdoor_seating`, `delivery`, `reservations`) could back the service-shape session parameter (PRD story 8), which currently has no Foursquare backing — see [[service-shape-attributes-unbacked|service-shape-attributes-unbacked]]. A parameter, not a quiz question; needs a triage decision before it becomes an issue.

## Post-Q5 router fix (2026-05-18)

Decomposed via `/to-issues` after a dogfood session surfaced [[issues/bug-07-post-q5-router-unwired|bug-07]] — submitting Q5 on iOS dead-ends to the S00 Landing screen because the post-Q5 router (S04 Waiting → S05 Verdict) was never wired into `RootView`. The S04/S05 surfaces and stores exist and are unit-tested but are constructed nowhere in production. Two vertical slices; verdict-ready detection is by polling, not Realtime (a few-seconds delay after the final answer is acceptable — see bug-07 §Fix scope).

Build order: tb-19 first (stands up the post-quiz host + `RootView` wiring on the solo path), then tb-20 (adds the group S04 Waiting surface on the same host).

**Adjacencies flagged on bug-07, not filed.** Realtime upgrade for live S04 peer updates; S06 Locked / S07 Reroll / S08 Check-in routing — the same unwired-surface pattern, separate follow-ups.

## Verdict-pipeline integration fix (2026-05-18)

Decomposed via `/to-issues` from [[issues/bug-08-verdict-pipeline-integration-unwired|bug-08]] — the verdict candidate-pool + preference-scoring integration (PRD modules A/E/G) was never wired; `options` is empty across all 2587 rooms and the verdict path has never produced a row. bug-08's architecture fork was decided 2026-05-18: **Option 2 (server-side)** — the union + preference-scoring runs server-side at verdict fire time; iOS writes only raw fetch results. Three vertical slices.

Build order: tb-21 and tb-22 run in parallel (both unblocked); tb-23 after both. tb-22 is a deliberate horizontal slice — a pure Swift→TS port verified by its ported test vectors — kept separate for parallelism and a focused port-vs-wiring review split. The group path is folded into tb-21/tb-23 acceptance criteria, not its own slice: Option 2's server-side union has no solo/group special case. Full *auto*-fire end-to-end also needs [[issues/bug-09-verdict-fire-dispatch-guc-noop|bug-09]] (GUCs); the slices stay verifiable without it via direct `compute-verdict` invoke.

tb-21/tb-22/tb-23 + bug-09 all merged 2026-05-18 — the verdict pipeline is now wired end to end. tb-24 (the tb-23 adjacency — iOS Q5 write path) merged 2026-05-18 (PR #131): the iOS quiz now emits `votes.q5.answer.ratings` as the factorial `[{droppedAxis, score}]` probe, so the per-member preference re-weight is no longer a no-op. The verdict pipeline's Q5 producer side is now fully wired to the server contract.

## Candidate-pool floor (2026-05-19)

A `/grill-with-docs` session pinned down a leak found in an earlier undocumented diagnosis: the per-member Foursquare fetch's general call carried no category scope, so non-restaurant venues (parks, gyms, retail) leaked into both the Q5 candidate pool and the verdict candidate set. The session produced [[../../60_engineering/adr/0012-candidate-pool-floor|ADR 0012]] — the **candidate-pool floor**, a named eight-category `Dining and Drinking` allowlist applied as a fetch-time hard filter on every call. `CONTEXT.md` gained the **Candidate pool** + **Candidate-pool floor** terms; `v1.1-quiz-amendments` §5 carries an amendment note.

## Remove fictitious fallback venues (2026-05-19)

Decomposed via `/to-issues` from a design session. The iOS app papers over an
empty Q5 candidate pool with three hardcoded fictitious restaurants
(`QuizDummyCandidates` — Pico's Taqueria / Ren Soba House / Bar Pastoral), a
tb-04-era scaffold. Decision: remove all fictitious venues — the app must never
surface a made-up place to a user. Q5 instead renders a `no-results` mode with a
forward CTA so the member is never stranded ("skip ahead"). Two slices, the
established spec-gap → tracer-bullet pairing (cf. `sg-02`→`tb-01`).

| TB-26 (v1.1) | [[issues/tb-26-remove-fictitious-fallback-venues\|Remove fictitious fallback venues; render the Q5 no-results screen]] ✅ done — `QuizDummyCandidates` deleted from the iOS app target; the four no-results paths resolve the candidate fetch to a `.noResults` source with an empty candidate list; new `QuizQ5NoResults` view renders sg-05's `no-results` mode (locked copy) with a forward CTA that submits Q1–Q4 + an empty Q5; `compute-verdict` already tolerated the empty `votes.q5.answer.ratings` array (equal-weight prior) — confirmed by a Deno test, no server change; decision in [[../../60_engineering/adr/0013-no-fictitious-fallback-venues\|ADR 0013]] | AFK | [#137](https://github.com/samfarls55/gettoit/issues/137) | sg-05 |

Build order: sg-05 first (specs the `no-results` Q5 mode in `design-system/`),
then tb-26 (deletes `QuizDummyCandidates`, renders the no-results screen against
the spec, wires the skip-ahead submit path, files the decision as an ADR).

## Verdict-spinner diagnosis (2026-05-19)

`/diagnose` against TestFlight build 267 (with the PR #141 `debug_trace`
breadcrumb instrumentation) split "the app still gets stuck at the verdict
screen" into **two independent defects** — and disproved the earlier
"`fetchVerdict` hangs" hypothesis (the breadcrumb trail showed the fetch
returning a verdict cleanly). `/to-issues` decomposed the fix into 4 AFK issues.

- **bug-12** — the post-Q5 verdict screen never renders: a double `onSubmitted`
  makes `RootView` build a second `PostQuizHost`, and SwiftUI binds the screen
  to a host that is never polled; the verdict resolves on the orphaned host.
- **bug-13 / bug-14** — the engine wedge: `compute-verdict` 404s on an empty
  candidate pool (`bug-13`, server) and iOS fires the verdict before the
  member's fetch is persisted (`bug-14`, client). ~46 of 160 rooms wedged in
  `firing` on 2026-05-19.
- **ops-01** — re-fires the already-wedged prod rooms; blocked by bug-13.

Build order: bug-12, bug-13, bug-14 are independent and can run in parallel;
ops-01 runs after bug-13. bug-12 also reverts the PR #141 `debug_trace`
instrumentation (delete `DebugTrace.swift` + call sites, drop the prod table).

### Solo-session post-mortem (2026-05-19 evening)

A solo TestFlight session produced the verdict `Robert's Western World` — a
Nashville honky-tonk. Confirmed in prod (`gettoit-prod` room `d11b3983`,
verdict `2026-05-19T20:41:15Z`): the winning option's `payload.categories` =
`["Bar","Burger Joint","Rock Club"]`. The ADR 0012 candidate-pool floor is a
query-time OR allowlist on Foursquare's `fsq_category_ids` — it scopes which
categories *can match*, but it cannot exclude a venue that *also* carries a
floor-eligible category. Robert's matched the `Restaurant` parent via its
`Burger Joint` tag and entered the pool legitimately; `categories.first`
rendered the verdict as a Bar.

- **bug-15** — pool-floor allows multi-category bars; the structural companion
  to ADR 0012 / tb-25. Fix is a shape-time primary-class gate + an
  entertainment-venue backstop, enforced in `shapeFoursquareResult` (one
  point reaches Q5 probe, candidate-pool union, and verdict pool). ADR 0012
  amended to record the new contract and its known limitations
  (Foursquare-ordering noise, cross-time instability).

## AFK-run follow-ups (2026-05-21)

The 2026-05-21-1812 AFK execution run (9 workflow-overhaul + v1.1 issues, all
merged — see [[2026-05-21-1812-afk-execution-log|run log]]) surfaced three
adjacencies its subagents flagged but did not fix (out of each issue's scope).
Filed as HITL bugs at `needs-triage`:

| # | Title | Type | GitHub | Blocked by |

- **bug-17** — re-scoped 2026-05-22 via `/triage` + `/grill-with-docs`. The
  filed symptom did not reproduce (`SessionRoom` already passes `votes: []`;
  the suggested `verdict_for_room` RPC does not exist). Real defect: the web
  verdict surface does not conform to the locked `web-01-invitee-shell.md` §C
  (plan name + venue only). ready-for-agent (AFK).
- **bug-18** — a `tsc --noEmit` error in `web/lib/quiz.test.ts` left by
  tb-WF-10; the web CI lane runs only `npm test` + `next build`, so it ships
  green.
- **bug-19** — `web/components/InviteWebCard.tsx` is dead code after the
  tb-WF-11 / tb-WF-12 invitee-shell rebuild.

## bug-17 grill follow-up (2026-05-22)

The bug-17 re-scoping `/grill-with-docs` session surfaced two follow-ups. One
is filed here; the sibling — the §C no-survivor spec-gap — is filed in the
workflow-overhaul folder as `sg-WF-9` (#215), since it amends a
workflow-overhaul design-system surface.

## UI dogfood batch (2026-05-24)

Eight UI-specific issues captured from a dogfood pass over the post-tb-WF-9 build. A `/grill-with-docs` session on 2026-05-24 classified seven of the eight as `ready-for-agent` (AFK); `bug-27` (reroll broken) was deferred to a separate `/diagnose` session and sits at `needs-info` pending a TestFlight build number, a failure timestamp, and answers to the diagnose worksheet in its issue body.

Resolutions of note:
- The user's `"Impeccable"` reference for bug-23 was resolved as the `impeccable:impeccable` skill loaded in this session (not a Refero / Figma reference). The skill ran inline against C-26 and recommended a token + structural rework — see bug-23 §Grill outcome for the chosen treatment.
- bug-22 (verdict Start-over → Home) and bug-26 (cuts-drawer removal) are interlocked: bug-22 makes Home pure navigation; bug-26 removes the friction-free change-of-mind path. Together they leave the reroll path (with its 3-burn, stated-reason friction) as the only re-decide channel.
- bug-24 introduces a new component primitive `C-27 · Action Sheet` (native-iOS-shaped, content-height detent, native grabber) that supplements `C-16 Bottom Sheet` rather than replacing it; C-16 stays in place for rich modal editors (reroll, location picker). (Grilled as `C-2N` placeholder; assigned C-27 at edit time as the next sequential slot after C-25 / C-26.)
- bug-28 was reframed during the grill from a pure copy-fix to a spec amendment — the solo audience subtitle is dropped entirely, not relabeled to `"YOU"`.

## Resolutions (post-grilling, 2026-05-14)

Resolution context captured during a `/grill-me` session run on the candidate table above. `/to-issues` or `/triage` should consume this section when splitting into individual `issues/<NN>-<slug>.md` files. Numbers map to the candidate table; deltas (splits, withdrawals, deferrals) called out inline.

### #1 — Invite link → 404 (bug, P0)
- **Fix scope:** URL resolution bug fix + regression test.
- **Regression test:** synthetic E2E in CI that (a) curls the live invite URL and (b) hits the AASA validator endpoint. Not just unit tests on URL generation — the bug was a live-plumbing failure and the test must catch live-plumbing regressions.
- **Investigate alongside #2a/#2b** (shared AASA / universal-links root-cause candidate from TB-00 + TB-02). Closing one may close the other.

### #2a — Static placeholder OG image (bug, was #2)
- **Split from original #2.** This sub-issue ships in v1.1; #2b deferred (see below).
- **Deliverables:** placeholder `/og/invite.png` (any gradient or solid color — explicitly **non-branded** for v1.1) + Open Graph / Twitter / Apple meta tags wired into `web/app/join/[roomId]/page.tsx`.
- **Acceptance:** pasting a `/join/<roomId>` link into iMessage shows a card (any card), not plain blue text.
- **Branding deferred:** see #2b.

### #2b — Branded / dynamic OG card (DEFERRED to pre-public-launch milestone)
- **Out of v1.1 scope.** Lands in pre-public-launch milestone (before any non-self user joins the platform).
- **Static branded card** comes first (lighter dependency). **Dynamic per-invite card** blocked on resolving initiator display-name source — intersects #9 profile-level data definition.
- **File as spec-gap + product-decision** when triaged for the milestone.

### #3 — Q5 (Regret?) shows placeholder, not real `PlacesService` candidates (bug)
- **Diagnostic clue:** Foursquare API logs show **zero calls** during a quiz pass. Either `PlacesService` is never invoked from the Q5 code path, or a guard short-circuits before the call. Stub-never-replaced vs wiring-broken-upstream — unknown.
- **Route through `diagnose` skill at fix time.** Start trace at `VerdictEngine` / Q5 view-model, walk up to `PlacesService.fetch()`.
- **Test scope:**
  - Unit test on Q5 view-model with canned `PlacesService` output (regression guard against placeholder-strings).
  - Boundary assertion that `PlacesService.fetch()` is actually invoked during a session (would have caught this exact bug — silent no-call is the failure mode).
  - Manual TestFlight smoke check on device.

### #4 — Motion lag (bug, P2)
- **Fix scope:** per-screen surgical `CHOREO` constant edit to align gradient curve duration with card transition. User confirmed the lag is on **every** question transition, so the fix likely lands in one shared transition primitive.
- **Verification:** on-device pass walking Q1→Q6 (or whatever count v1.1 lands on after #9), confirming no peer lag.
- **`verify.mjs` green required.** If verification surfaces another offender, folded into the same fix (not a separate motion review).

### #5 — Home-page subheader contrast (spec-gap)
- **Failure:** white subheader text on the brightest band of the initiator/home gradient (the first, yellow-heavy stop).
- **Fix:** **token-level**. Edit the on-gradient subheader role in `design-system/tokens.json` (likely `color.text.on-gradient.secondary` or new restricted role) so it clears WCAG AA (4.5:1) against the brightest gradient stop.
- **Likely change:** shift from pure white toward a tinted dark.
- **Verify with:** `design-system/accessibility.md` contrast table + `verify.mjs`. Spot-check every surface consuming that role for regressions.

### #6 — Landing page surface (spec-gap + tracer-bullet)
- **New surface above the existing flow.** Two buttons, nothing else for v1.1:
  - **Start a Decision** (or similar wording) → routes into existing "Pick a Vertical" screen → existing food flow.
  - **Account Settings** → routes to existing delete-your-data page.
- **Visual / brand design deferred.** v1.1 ships the structural surface only; user will design fully later.
- **Folds in #11** (sliders); see #11 below.
- **Does NOT introduce a category selector** — "Pick a Vertical" already exists with food enabled and drinks/movies stubbed. No new functionality.

### #7 — Account creation flow (spec-gap + tracer-bullet)
- **Initiator path:** **forced Sign in with Apple gate on first launch.** App is unusable until signed in. iPhone-only assumption holds.
- **Invitee path:** click invite link → anonymous auth (unchanged from today) → straight into questionnaire → on the waiting screen, present a **"Download the app"** CTA. App install triggers their own first-launch Apple sign-in.
- **Profile-edit surface (allergies / dietary / cuisine):** **deferred** to pre-public-launch milestone.
- **v1.1 deliverables narrow to:** (a) force Apple sign-in on first launch, (b) waiting-screen "Download the app" CTA.

### #8 — Geography / location permission surface (spec-gap + tracer-bullet)
- **When prompt fires:** pre-quiz, on tapping "Start a Decision," before the Pick a Vertical screen. Pre-prime card explains *why* (restaurant recs need location), then native iOS dialog.
- **Persistent location selector UI:** location is **always editable**. Auto-populates if permission granted, requires manual selection if denied, user can override the auto-populated value in either case.
- **No "denied = broken app" failure mode.** Denied users still have a viable path via manual selection.
- **Adjacency RESOLVED (2026-05-14):** [[../../60_engineering/adr/0009-locationpicker-as-reusable-component|ADR 0009]] picks Path B — reusable `C-23 LocationPicker` component, not a one-off composition. Original "extend `MapKitPlacesFallback`" framing was a category error (data-layer service, not a UI primitive). Agent has token / copy / Refero authority on this issue; see the issue body for the granted-autonomy list.

### #9 — Questions rework, profile vs session split (product-decision, RESOLVED)
- **Decision recorded in:** `50_product/questions-profile-vs-session-split.md` (to be created — does not yet exist, must be written before `/to-issues` runs).
- **Split rule:** identity / body / values = **profile** (sticky, lives on account). Right-now context = **session** (asked every run).
- **Profile-level items:**
  - Allergies
  - Dietary restrictions (vegan, keto, halal)
  - Cuisine preferences ("I love Thai")
  - Cuisine dislikes ("hate seafood")
- **Session-level items:**
  - Budget tier
  - Mood
  - Hunger level
  - Solo / partner / group
  - Indoor / outdoor / takeout
- **Deferred from v1.1 entirely** (out of both buckets, not just reassigned):
  - Distance willing to travel
  - Time available
  - Justification: v1.1 assumes all participants in the same general geographic area; multi-geo decisions are out of scope.
- **Future product direction:** passive preference learning from answer history over time — preferences should emerge, explicit capture stays opt-in. Document alongside the split rule in `50_product/`.
- **Issue type:** product-decision → resolves to a `50_product/` decision note, no spec-gap or tracer-bullet child issues spawn for the split itself in v1.1. (Surfaces consuming the split — profile-edit surface, anon 6th question — both deferred per #10 and #7.)

### #10 — Anonymous-user fallback 6th question (DEFERRED to pre-public-launch milestone)
- **Out of v1.1 scope.** Originally proposed: anon users get a pre-Q1 multi-select asking allergies + dietary restrictions (the safety subset of profile data). After #7 lock (no profile-edit surface in v1.1), capturing this data anonymously created an inconsistency: authed users had no place to store the same data.
- **Resolution:** defer **all** allergy / dietary handling — anon 6th question AND profile-edit surface — to the pre-public-launch milestone, so they land together.
- **v1.1 recommender is allergy-blind by design.** Acceptable risk because only the user-as-self is on the platform during v1.1; no real recipients of bad recs.
- **Was blocked on #9; #9 now resolved, but item still deferred for the reason above.**

### #11 — Landing-page distance + time sliders (WITHDRAWN, folded into #6)
- **Not a separate issue.** v1.1 has no distance + time inputs anywhere (see #9 deferrals). Sliders are simply removed from the landing surface.
- **No follow-up artifact.** Folded entirely into the new #6 landing-surface scope (two-button surface, no sliders).

## v1.1 → pre-public-launch milestone handoff

Items explicitly deferred out of v1.1 that **must land before the first non-self user** joins the platform. See [[../../../../../home/node/.claude/projects/-workspace/memory/project_pre_public_launch_milestone|project_pre_public_launch_milestone memory]] for the planning-checkpoint framing.

- **#2b** — branded OG image (static, then dynamic per-invite once display-name source resolved)
- **#10** — allergy / dietary capture (anon 6th question + persistent profile-edit surface — land as a pair)
- **Profile-edit surface** — cuisine likes/dislikes editor (intersects #7 settings surface)
- **Distance + time inputs** — re-enter scope when multi-geo decisions become a thing (likely tied to expanding beyond a single test cohort)
- **`support@gettoit.app` mailbox / forwarding** — deferred 2026-05-14 from [[../v1/issues/tb-16-privacy-legal-delete|TB-16]] because the operator couldn't log into the registrar email console mid-walkthrough. PP + ToS already cite the address as the contact for deletion / CCPA / informal dispute resolution. Cheapest fix is Namecheap / Cloudflare email-forwarding rule into the operator's existing Outlook account. Must land before the App Store public listing or any non-friend invitee joins.

Triage these when planning the milestone after v1.1 ships. Not appropriate to file as v1.1 issues now.

## Adjacencies surfaced during grilling

- **`LocationPicker` component** — RESOLVED 2026-05-14 as `C-23 LocationPicker` per [[../../60_engineering/adr/0009-locationpicker-as-reusable-component|ADR 0009]]. Stub slot reserved in `design-system/components.md`; agent fills in the full spec during sg-04 work.
- **Account Settings surface (existing)** — currently a delete-your-data page. #6 wires the landing-page button to it; #7 may extend it further in pre-public-launch milestone for the profile-edit surface.
