# TASK

Fix issue {{TASK_ID}}: {{ISSUE_TITLE}}

Pull in the issue using `gh issue view {{TASK_ID}} --comments`. If it has a parent PRD, pull that in too.

Only work on the issue specified.

Work on branch {{BRANCH}}. Make commits and run tests.

# CONTEXT

Here are the last 10 commits:

<recent-commits>

!`git log -n 10 --format="%H%n%ad%n%B---" --date=short`

</recent-commits>

# EXPLORATION

Explore only issue-relevant files. Start with:

1. `gh issue view {{TASK_ID}} --comments`
2. `docs/agents/verification.md`
3. `AGENTS.md`
4. `CONTEXT.md`
5. Directly relevant package docs and tests

Avoid broad repo scans. Exclude `.sandcastle/**`, `node_modules/**`, `.next/**`, build outputs, generated caches, and prior worktrees.

# EXECUTION

If applicable, use RGR to complete the task.

1. RED: write one test
2. GREEN: write the implementation to pass that test
3. REPEAT until done
4. REFACTOR the code

# FEEDBACK LOOPS

Before committing, use `docs/agents/verification.md` to choose the narrowest checks that prove the change. Run those checks.

# COMMIT

Make a git commit. The commit message must:

1. Start with `RALPH:` prefix
2. Include task completed + PRD reference
3. Key decisions made
4. Files changed
5. Blockers or notes for next iteration

Keep it concise.

# THE ISSUE

If the task is not complete, leave a comment on the issue with what was done.

Do not close the issue - this will be done later.

Once complete, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.

# FINAL RULES

ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE TASK.
